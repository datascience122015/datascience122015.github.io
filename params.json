It is not related to gender and age. It uses the same formula for men as for women and children.\r\n\r\nThe body mass index is calculated based on the following formula:\r\n\r\nBodyweight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared\r\n\r\n$$BMI = \\frac{x KG}{y Meter *  y Meter}`$$\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\nx=bodyweight in KG\r\ny=height in m\r\n\r\nThe result is in kilograms by meters squared, or KG/M2. In most cases, people simply leave out this designation. It doesn't have any real significance because humans don't equate to real mathematical squares as the formula might suggest.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n===\r\nFunctionality   \r\n===\r\n\r\n**Inputs** to the System:\r\n\r\n1. User Name\r\n2. Age\r\n3. Height\r\n4. Weight\r\n\r\n**Expected output** from the System:\r\n\r\n1. Calculated BMI\r\n2. System registered input data \r\n3. Recommendation from the system\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n===\r\nTechnical Details\r\n===\r\nThe application is fully contained in the files **server.R and ui.R**, and the user input widgets are monitored for changes.\r\n\r\nOnce a change is detected, a segment of code is executed, making the calculations requested, and the screen is updated.\r\n\r\nTo show information to the user there's two sections available. The first one will always show the date the user has inserted, and the second one will show the results of the calculations made.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n===\r\nShiny App\r\n===\r\n```{r, echo=FALSE, opts.label = 'shiny'}\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\ninputPanel(textInput(\"name\",\"Name:\",\"Hello!!!\"),\r\nnumericInput(\"age\",\"Age (greater than 18):\",\"19\",min= 19,max = 95,step=1),\r\nradioButtons(\"sex\", \"Gender:\", c(\"Male\" = \"male\",\"Female\" = \"female\", \"Neutral\" = \"neutral\"   ) ),\r\nsliderInput(\"height\", \"Height in centimeter\", value = 150,min = 150,    max = 250), \r\nsliderInput(\"weight\", \"Body Weight in Kilogram\",  value = 50,min = 50, max = 200)   )\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n===\r\nTHANK YOU\r\n===\r\n\r\n",
